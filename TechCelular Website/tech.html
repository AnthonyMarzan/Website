				<h2>5G NR technology coming soon<h2>
				<p>
					It is looking like the new 5G NR technology is on track for a release next year. NR which is now known as ('New Radio') technology has been flaunted in many live demos showing the 
					potential the new technology has.
				</p>
				
				<div class="techParagraph" id="p2">
					<p>
						Qualcomm showed off a prototype smarthphone demo connected to a 5G tower, reaching a throughput of over 4Gbps which is a big jump from 4G celular performances. 
						"Intel and Huawei were also showing off hardware prototypes, though less impressive. Intel had a weird tablet capable of streaming a not particularly intensive 4K video over 5G,
						while Huawei were showing off modem technology that wasn't at the same compact level as Qualcomm. That said, both companies are well in the 5G tech race, along with many others."
						cited from TechSpot's coverage on their article.

				<h2>In-display fingerprint sensor technology<h2>
				<p>
					There has been many rumors about different phone companies developing in-display fingerprint sensor technologies. You would think Samsung and Apple would be the first 2 companies to release
					such tech on their new flagship devices, but they were beaten to the punch by Vivo. Vivo, who are a major chinese smartphone brand have released the new fingerprint sensor technology with their X20 Plus UD smartphones. 
				</p>
				<div class="techParagraph" id="p3">
					<p>
						Quoted from the news article on TheVerge "The phone is the result of collaboration between Vivo and Synaptics, the US-based sensor maker. We tried out the in-display fingerprint sensor on a pre-production phone at CES 2018 earlier this month, 
						and it ended up winning our Best in Show award."
					</p>
					<p>
						Hopefully the tech would be further enhanced, as the reviews with the Vivo phone containing the new sensor is none too impressive. Samsungs new S10 line seems to be implemnting the new sensor, but has not been confirmed. 
						As Samsung's are one of the leaders in displays I would not be suprised if they pull it off. 
					</p>
